# Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Grid Worlds
Intelligent Robotics Module Final Group Project - University of Birmingham

Harry Clemence, Kai Meller, Jack Mortimer, Shankari Venkatesh

The robot is placed in an interactive grid world maze which contains puzzles and obstacles
to avoid. The robot will begin with no prior knowledge of the environment or how it should
interact with it to complete the maze. We propose a reinforcement learning approach, where
the robot will have to determine which actions to take based on its observed state, over time
generating a policy for the map. The aim of the project is to investigate a reinforcement
learning approach to changeable grid based environments. We will aim to deal with maze
problems where the most effective or even only possible solutions require the agent to interact
with or avoid changeable obstacles. We have considered mobile obstacles which move in a pre-
dictable or probabilistic pattern, objects which may change state such as impassable/passable,
or objects which may be collected for specific purposes such as keys.
